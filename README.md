# Other things
- Big thanks to [MOPSKATER](https://github.com/MOPSKATER) for helping with this dramatically haha

If you want to launch your game faster, add `--melonloader.hideconsole` to launch properties (right click the game on steam -> properties -> launch options at the bottom of that window) to hide the console that melonloader loads in.
